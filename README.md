### Software will never be the same again

Design, build, and run powerful workflows to automate repetitive tasks, still in its nascent stages

##Legoized Software For Humans and Developers
With Automata, software will never be the same again. It introduces a new paradigm for software wherein each application is shipped as components. As such, applications can be used independently or used to build more larger, modular systems. Automata makes accessible specialized solutions to specific problems one faces.

You can build workflows to automate life's repetitive tasks with the help of a library of existing modules developed by the community and built in to the automata platform. The workflows you build can be exported as standalone applications, a cli, or eventually a web service that can be accessed anywhere with an internet connection.
